Hello Lads, 
  My name is Jonathan Johnson and I am currently studying Cybersecurity at Southeast Missouri State University. Cybersecurity is one of my greatest hobbies, so I thought I would make a blog, to show some of my projects that I do and the discoveries I make inside. Most of these projects will be Threat Hunting/Detection based, but I will be showing other projects from different verticals as well. 
  
 For any questions, feel free to email me @ jonathansjohnson1996@gmail.com
 
  Thank you for tuning in,
  Hope you enjoy!
