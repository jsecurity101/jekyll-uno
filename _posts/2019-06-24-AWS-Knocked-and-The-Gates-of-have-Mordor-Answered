Background:
---
<p><a href="https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/mordor"><strong>Mordor</strong></a> is a project that was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/Cyb3rWard0g"><strong>Roberto Rodriguez</strong></a> and his brother <a href="https://twitter.com/Cyb3rPandaH"><strong>Jose Rodriguez</strong></a>. 
This project has “pre-recorded security events generated by simulated adversarial techniques in the form of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files for easy consumption.” 
This means that Mordor has pre-recorded data that has been collected from adversarial techniques (based off of the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/"><strong>MITRE ATT&CK</strong></a>) that have already been run in a lab. 
Mordor allows data to be consumed by anything. We can do this, due to the fact it is formatted as a <strong><i>json</i></strong> file.  
In this lab we will index the data through Elasticsearch, either by utilizing Kafkacat or Jupyter Notebooks. 
This is a huge leap for the community in terms of data collection and analysis. 
Mordor enables individuals and teams to test their Detection strategies through pre-recorded datasets in a high quality and robust way. </p>

<p>Being that Mordor is a powerful way to learn and understand data, I wanted to create a way for myself and others to be able to spin up a replica of this lab.  Making it reproducible and simple so anyone can build it, then start playing with the datasets themselves. You can even create your own datasets. Due to this, I created a Terraform automation script, that builds a lab utilizing pre-built AMI’s inside of AWS. This allows a user to build and tear down the Mordor lab in a matter of minutes, also allowing them to start playing around with the pre-recorded data-sets just as quickly.</p> 

Starting the Lab:

<p>Roberto and I wanted this setup process for the lab to be as painless as possible. Due to this, we automated as much as we could. To start the lab follow the steps listed here: https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/mordor/tree/mordor_aws/environment/shire/terraform</p>
